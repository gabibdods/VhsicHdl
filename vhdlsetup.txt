Got it — since you're now going with **GtkSourceView 5**, you'll need to build it from source. Here’s a clean step-by-step guide to building and installing `libgtksourceview-5-dev` on **WSL (Ubuntu)**:

---

## ✅ STEP 1: Install Build Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  build-essential \
  meson \
  ninja-build \
  libgtk-4-dev \
  libglib2.0-dev \
  libpango1.0-dev \
  libxml2-dev \
  libgirepository1.0-dev \
  gettext \
  gobject-introspection \
  git
```

---

## ✅ STEP 2: Clone GtkSourceView

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtksourceview.git
cd gtksourceview
```

> If you want to pin a stable version:

```bash
git checkout 5.10.0
```

---

## ✅ STEP 3: Build and Install

```bash
meson setup builddir --prefix=/usr
ninja -C builddir
sudo ninja -C builddir install
```

You now have `libgtksourceview-5` and its headers installed system-wide in `/usr/include/`.

---

## ✅ STEP 4: Verify Installation

```bash
pkg-config --modversion gtksourceview-5
```

Should output something like `5.10.0`.

---

## ✅ STEP 5: Update Your Rust Project

### `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
gtk = { version = "0.7", package = "gtk4" }
gtksourceview = { version = "0.7", package = "sourceview5" }
gio = "0.17"
glib = "0.17"
```

---

## ✅ STEP 6: Make Sure `pkg-config` Works

Before compiling Rust, export the environment to ensure GTK and GtkSourceView are detected:

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
```

Or append them to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`.

Then run:

```bash
cargo build
```

Would you like me to now regenerate your `main.rs` with a working GtkSourceView 5 example, including VHDL highlighting?
